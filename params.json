  "body": "## What is it?\r\nRPi-youtube is a simple extension and local program combo to allow you to run youtube videos smoothly on the Raspberry Pi. If you install RPi-youtube when installing chromium (`sudo apt-get install rpi-youtube`) and have installed the [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rpi-youtube/laacchpjldmpbhkcjfmfcjijaekhhlgn) then by simply clicking the icon on a youtube video it will pause it and open up nice and full screen for you to watch. It works on any of [these 600+ websites.] (https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html)\r\n![](https://github.com/kusti8/RPi-chromium/raw/master/spinner_1280x800.png)\r\n\r\n## Install it\r\nInstallation is simple:\r\n```\r\nwget -qO - http://bintray.com/user/downloadSubjectPublicKey?username=bintray | sudo apt-key add -\r\necho \"deb http://dl.bintray.com/kusti8/chromium-rpi jessie main\" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list\r\nsudo apt-get update\r\nsudo apt-get install chromium-browser rpi-youtube -y\r\n```\r\nIf you already ran these instructions to install Chromium, there's no need to install it again.\r\nTo update which should be done regularly:\r\n`run_omxplayer.py -U`\r\n\r\n## How does it work?\r\nRPi-youtube is divided into two sections, the extension and the native app.\r\n### The extension\r\nThe extension is totally separate from the native app. It lives in Chromium and its job is to detect youtube links or detect clicks on the icon. Once one of those is detected, it retrieves the url and sends what's called a native message to the native app. Because of security concerns, Chrome apps are not allowed to directly start or execute code on the machine. Instead, you must send a message to a program locally which will execute everything. The main part of the program is the native app.\r\n### The native app\r\nThe native app is called run_omxplayer.py and is a simple python script which reads the input through stdin and then runs omxplayerGUI with that url. run_omx.json is a manifest file which is installed in /etc/chromium-browser/native-messaging-hosts which tells Chromium where to find the program and all the necessary information. Once a message is sent to run_omxplayer.py, it reads that and runs omxplayerGUI.\r\n\r\n## Support\r\nAny feature requests can be opened as issues on the Github page.
